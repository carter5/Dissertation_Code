# Dissertation Code
By Jarai Carter, 2019

## Introduction
This R code was used for the text analysis I performed on Facebook data collected for my dissertation titled *USE OF AND INFORMATION SEEKING BEHAVIORS ON FACEBOOK AMONG ILLINOIS FARMERS AND FARM FAMILIES*. In this analysis, the text was cleaned, word and bigram frequencies were calculated, and tf-idf scores were calculated for words. The results were then visualized. To see the results of this analysis, you can read my dissertation (open access) located at this link [here](http://hdl.handle.net/2142/105640).

## Requirements
This [file](r_package_versions.txt) has the version of R that I was running with all the associated packages and their versions listed.

## Resources
Here are some great resources that I used for select packages:  
- [tidytext](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)
- [ggplot2](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/)
- [igraph](https://kateto.net/network-visualization)
