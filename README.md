# Dissertation Code
By Jarai Carter, 2019

## Introduction
This R code was used for the text analysis I performed on Facebook data collected for my dissertation titled *italicized*. In this analysis, the text was cleaned, word and bigram frequencies were calculated, and tf-idf scores were calculated for words. The results were then visualized. To see the results of this analysis, you can read my dissertation (open access) located at this link here. (A link will be added when it becomes public.)

## Requirements
This [file](r_package_versions.txt) has the version of R that I was running with all the associated packages and their versions listed.

## Resources
Here are some great resources that I used when learning about the different packages:  
- [tidytext](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)
- [ggplot2](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/)
